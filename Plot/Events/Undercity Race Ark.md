In order to contact [[The Bête Noire]], the players must beat them in Undercity [[Illegal Racing]]. To do so, they will have to work with some mechanics to acquire the final part for their racing vehicle; a rare [[Power Core]]. These power cores are held by the [[Ænigma Police]] and are expressly illegal for the party to have. 
To acquire the power core the players will:
- Sneak into the police headquarters.
- Find their way through the building.
- Steal the power core.
- Sneak back out without getting caught.
--> [[Getting the Power Core]]

Once they have the power core, the mechanics can finish the vehicle and begin the soonest race.
