- If they search his house and belongings, they'll find a note describing the next meeting location and time for The Anathema.
- If the players eavesdrop on the meeting, they'll find that the members are planning for something they refer to as [[The Changing]]. The Changing will use [[Silver (drug)|Silver]] as one of its components, and it turns out The Anathema have been testing it on [[Skints]].

- One-by-one the players must kill the Anathema while gathering information on what [[The Changing]] is.
- [[The End]]
