Silver is an experimental chemical invented by [[The Anathema]] under the guidance of [[Lear]]. The Anathema hope that once Silver is stable, it will allow them to survive [[The Changing]]. 
Silver is injected through veins and looks like a silver gel. A bit like mercury.
People who take Silver often manifest unusual symptoms like metallic skin, strangely-colored eyes, loss of hair, or even additional appendages.
Currently, everyone who has ever taken Silver has died soon after, but The Anathema are getting close to making a stable version of the drug.

If a plater injects Silver, they will experience a massive boost to strength and wisdom while slowly manifesting multiple symptoms. Every hour their intelligence will go down. Once it reaches zero or lower, the characters HP will drop to zero.
