The Ænigma is a titanic airship that continuously circumnavigates the world. It is, to most extents, a floating city. 
The Ænigma is far too large to ever land because its own weight would crush it. Instead, it resides in near-cosmic orbit where gravity is weak enough for the airship to exist. It also serves to keep the city shielded from ground-based attacks.
Ænigma's economy revolves around the profitable business of harvesting gases from the upper-atmosphere as well as numerous private prisons. Due to its airborn nature, Ænigma is extremely hard to escape from, leading to an ever growing population of criminals and killers.
Despite all this, the economy is in a constant state of inflation. Everything is more and more expensive while everything pays less and less.

Many refer to Ænigma as a "The Living City" or "The Blind Mother".
