Ænigma is a rotten city for some, and the best of vacations for others.
The elite live in their silver spires, the poor below. Many live and die never setting foot on real ground. The poor are born, raised, and killed on Ænigma while the wealthy view the city as a fun biannual vacation place.

At first glance, it seems the city is fractured, ruled by petty gangs and whoever is foolish enough to try and rule some sector of the city.
If one were to investigate, however, they would find a relatively small number of organizations (known as [[Wardens]] in the under-city) controlling the majority of gangs and groups. 
Further investigation would show that the Wardens are privy to a group of elites known as [[The Anathema]]. The Anathema control the city as a sort of shadow government, dictating most decisions and public opinions. 
The most guarded secret however, the thing no one has ever found and lived to tell is that Anathema are not the highest in the power pyramid. There is, in fact one being above all else, only spoken of in hushed whispers and absolute secrecy. No one really knows the extent of its power, or what it is. It is only known as [[Lear]].
