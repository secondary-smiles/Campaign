The Anathema is a group of utmost secrecy. None but the [[Wardens|Warden]] leaders are aware of their existence, and even the Warden leaders are kept in the shadows as much as possible.
Serving as a shadow government, The Anathema dominate both [[The Overcity]] and [[The Undercity]], dictating major money flows, political decisions, and the greater [[Economy]]. 
The Anathema are composed of a small group of wealthy elites meeting in secret. While the [[Skints]] have no inkling of their existence, some may accidentally stumble upon clues of it. Those that The Anathema knows about are swiftly put to death.
No one knows the identity of any of the members of The Anathema.
The only being to whom the Anathema must defer to is known only as [[Lear]]. The Anathema dare not speak of Lear except in hushed whispers of utmost secrecy. For to speak of Lear is to dance with a grisly end.
