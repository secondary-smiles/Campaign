The Undercity refers to the majority of Ænigma, it is a dark, rotten place.
Murderers and rapists roam free, the police force barely keeping up with the petty criminals not to mention the dangerous ones.
The city lowlife refer to themselves as "skints", people of extreme poverty living on the streets trying to stay alive however they can.
[[Skints]] are exclusively folks who have not resorted to crime however. Skints condone those of the Ænigma who resort to violence and crime, as it only ever ends up hurting the undercity population.
