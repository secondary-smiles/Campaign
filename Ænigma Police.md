The Ænigma Police are the global police force for both [[The Undercity]] and [[The Overcity]]. They protect, defend, an uphold the moral codes of [[The Ænigma]].
Recently, [[The Anathema]] has seeded a Yuan-Ti overtaking of the Police force which has been successful. Where the police used to stand just and fail Yuan-Ti snakes stand instead. The Yuan-Ti are solely focused on exploiting [[The Undercity]] for food. Often, corpses can be found in the Undercity missing several limbs which look cauterized. This is from the acid venom the Yuan-Ti are capable of excreting. The [[Police Headquarters]] is the center of operations for all police business in the Overcity and Undercity.
